## Introduction

Fraudulent transactions pose a significant threat to financial institutions and customers. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze credit card transaction data and classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is highly imbalanced and contains anonymized credit card transaction data, including:

- Features derived from PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Time and amount of the transactions
- Labels indicating fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0) transactions

The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Features

- Preprocessing of imbalanced data using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
- Evaluation metrics including:
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - AUC-ROC Curve

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and modeling
- **NumPy** and **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting implementation

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SoniReddyMaram/CreditCardFraudDetection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd CreditCardFraudDetection
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies.

5. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder (e.g., `data/`).

## Usage

1. Preprocess the dataset:

   - Clean and normalize the data.
   - Handle class imbalance using oversampling or undersampling techniques.

2. Train the model:

   - Use the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train machine learning models.
   - Evaluate the performance of the models using the metrics provided.

3. Test the model:

   - Use the test set to validate the model's accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions.
